How to test the character sheet on the server:
- copy the content of the html between the START and END comments only (div "sheet-wrapper")
- copy the css file but comment out the "little hack" at the start
- copy the img folder

The assets folder contains css/js files downloaded from roll20 for my test purposes only.
